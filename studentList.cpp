  This is the project "Student List," which allows you to add a student to a "database" (or vector),
  delete the student from the vector, and output all students currently in the vetor.

  Concepts of interest:

  --> Using structs and pointers

  --> Using vectors

     --> Using iterators for vectors, as regular for loops are not appropiate here

  --> Input/Output Stream

      --> Entering a prompt in the command line (via keyboard) to have output in the command line (via display)
